Hello!

You have been selected as the new maintainer of a guesbook application. The old
maintainer no longer wishes to update it, and there's some problems with the
code.

Users have been complaining that their comments have been disappearing, and the
admin says he hasn't ever deleted comments or restarted the server. Not only
that, but more recently users have said that their comments are being posted
under the wrong name.

Good luck!
